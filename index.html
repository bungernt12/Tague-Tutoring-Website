          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Tague. I love to teach.</p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about tutoring and helping students grow. With a
            knack for breaking down complex concepts into understandable pieces,
            I guide students towards those 'aha' moments where everything
            clicks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in not just teaching the material but also in helping
            students develop effective study habits and life skills that will
            serve them well beyond their educational journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also believe that in-person tutoring is more productive and
            personal than virtual. I have the tech to do Zoom sessions, and in
            some circumstances, that's the best option. However, when possible,
            I recommend face-to-face tutoring.
          </p>

            "Tague arrived prepped and with enthusiastic energy to make the
            learning more fun and effective. My daughter was very comfortable
            working with him, asking questions, and felt listened to and
            supported in the process."
